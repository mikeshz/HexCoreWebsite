# Website for HexCore

HexCore is a project created at U of T Hacks 3 in a team of 4 (including myself). It shows a world map illuminated by different colours depending on how a particular country is feeling, and displays the top trending hashtags in that country. HexCore uses the Twitter streaming API to pull data from Twitter's servers, and compares it against an internal dictionary of words to judge the mood of a particular country.
